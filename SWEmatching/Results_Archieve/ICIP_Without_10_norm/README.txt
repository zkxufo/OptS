In these results, we have normlaized the YCbCr channels with 10*max(S_y) to make it simple to tune. 
To avoid confusion, we removed the scale factor by 10 and we tested it. It does not change the results
and everything is still the same. 

However, in these results, we did not apply the fast quantization yet. These results can only support
the experiments in the ICIP paper, not the extended version of it.
